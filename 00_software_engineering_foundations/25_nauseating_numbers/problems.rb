# perfect_square?
# Write a method perfect_square? that accepts a number as an argument. The method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the argument is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the product of some number multiplied by itself. For example, since 64 = 8 * 8 and 144 = 12 * 12, 64 and 144 are perfect squares; 35 is not a perfect square.

# Phase 2: Nothing you can't handle.

# anti_prime?
# Write a method anti_prime? that accepts a number as an argument. The method should return true if the given number has more divisors than all positive numbers less than the given number. For example, 24 is an anti-prime because it has more divisors than any positive number less than 24. Math Fact: Numbers that meet this criteria are also known as highly composite numbers.

# matrix_addition
# Let a 2-dimensional array be known as a "matrix". Write a method matrix_addition that accepts two matrices as arguments. The two matrices are guaranteed to have the same "height" and "width". The method should return a new matrix representing the sum of the two arguments. To add matrices, we simply add the values at the same positions:
